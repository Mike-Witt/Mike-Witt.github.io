<h3>The Sunday "Quantum Class"</h3>

For the past couple of years, my wife and I have taught a <i>very</i> simple
introduction to quantum theory on Sunday afternoons in Portland.
This is a free "community" class. The
idea is to explain just the basics, using the simplest possible mathematical
framework. This ends up being quantum theory in the "finite vector space"
$C^N$. The only prerequisite for the class is just basic (High School) algebra,
and much of the what is taught is actually an introduction to linear algebra
(vectors and matrices).
<p>
With this relatively simple mathematical framework it is then possible to
quantitatively discuss quantum theory in a discrete setting, like that
typically used for quantum information and quantum computing.
Topics that can be covered include: Electron spin, Entanglement, Quantum
Teleportation, and a simplified discussion of quantum correlations that
violate Bell's Inequality.
<p>
The hope is that this kind of information is useful to people who don't
have the time or background to take a college-level class in quantum mechanics,
but who would like to go beyond what can be learned from the many popular books
on quantum physics. Especially in terms of understanding why quantum physics
<b><i>does not</i></b> imply things like:
<ul>
<li> An electron can be in two places at once
<li> An entangled pair of particles "communicate faster than the speed of light"
<li> You create reality when you perceive it
<li> "Entangled minds" could explain ESP
<li> "Star Trek" like teleportation has been achieved by quantum physicists
<li> ... and so on.
</ul>
<p>
Here is a copy of the notes. Somewhat updated, but
unfortunately still far from being complete:

And here's a snapshot of the class in August 2014:

It contains various PDFs and IPython notebooks. Unfortunately these
represent only part of the material that was covered. Also, the notebooks
use IPython 2.0, <i>long</i> before the Jupyter integration. You can
still view them on nbviewer, although some of them look a bit weird. You
can download them, but I don't know how well they'll run on a current
IPython/Jupyter installation.  If anyone is interested in doing anything
further with these materials let me know, and I will assist if I can.
